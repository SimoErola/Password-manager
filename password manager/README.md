# Password Manager
Simply and clearly put, you are looking for a USB flash drive-based password management solution that can automatically input your passwords on websites and work seamlessly with both the command prompt (cmd) and the extensions for Chrome and Firefox browsers. Here is a detailed explanation:

USB Flash Drive-Based Password Management:
Choose a password management application that supports the use of a USB flash drive. It is recommended to select a reputable password management program such as LastPass, Dashlane, or KeePass.

Password Storage and Synchronization:
Install your chosen password management application and save your passwords in it. Ensure that the application provides synchronization options so that you can access your passwords on different devices.

CMD Compatibility:
Verify that your chosen password management solution is compatible with the command prompt (cmd). Most password management tools are operating system-independent, allowing them to be used in the command prompt.

Browser Extensions:
Install password management browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These extensions are typically offered directly by the password management application. They enable automatic password filling on login pages.

User Instructions:
Create clear instructions for using USB flash drive-based password management. Ensure that the instructions include steps for password storage, synchronization across devices, CMD usage, and installation of browser extensions.

Shortcut Keys:
Highlight convenient shortcut keys or functions that facilitate the use of password management. For example, provide guidance on quickly opening the command prompt or initiating functions of browser extensions.

This should offer you a simple and effective way to manage your passwords using a USB flash drive in both the command prompt and browsers.
